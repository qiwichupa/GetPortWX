# What is it

**GetPortWX** - is a tool for tracking MAC-address of "user device" through local network from the core router to a port on the end switch. Useful when you must change port settings for PC of employee, or something like that.

[Get latest release](https://github.com/qiwichupa/GetPortWX/releases/latest)

Really it is nothing but a GUI-version of "[port_report.py](https://github.com/qiwichupa/Linuxdynasty/blob/master/Port_Report_Tools/port_report.py)" script, originally written by Allen Sanabria, to be used as a standalone (first of all Windows) application. GetPortWX can do no more than the original script and has the same limitations and hardware compatibility.
